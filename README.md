# WeatherDiscordBot

A Discord bot built entirely with C# in order to get a better grasp of the language. 
Built mainly using the Discord.Net package.

The user can use the command **/weather-in {cityName}** in order to get some information about the current state of the weather in the given city.

This bot gets all the weather information by using the OpeanWeatherAPI
